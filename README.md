# Active Anomaly Aggregation

## Requirements

Python 3 (at least 3.10, up to 3.12 included).
Python's package manager pip is required for the installation.

## Installation

Unzip acanag.zip on your computer. You then need to open a terminal window (if you are using the Anaconda Navigator App GUI, first
open a terminal window inside your active virtual environment). 

If necessary, type 'ls' into the terminal window to see what folder you are inside currently. You then need to 
move from that folder to inside the main outer folder  of the unzipped library on your computer using command line commands.

When you are inside the main outer folder of the library, you can simply type into the terminal window:

    pip install .

Yes, the '.' is part of the command. 

## Usage

The Python functions in acanag only require a Python installation to function. However, you need to have the interactive web platform Jupyter running on your
computer in order to natively run the Jupyter notebook example in doc/source/content/examples. Ways to get Jupyter running on your computer via command line
tools or a graphical user interface such as Anaconda Navigator can be found online: jupyter.org and anaconda.com are good starting places. Otherwise, you
will have to convert the notebook .ipynb file to a .py script to run it.

An additional Jupyter notebook reproducing the results from the associated paper is found in doc/source/content/Reproducible.

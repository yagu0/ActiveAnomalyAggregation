# Active Anomaly Aggregation

## Requirements

Python 3 (at least 3.8, up to 3.12 included).
Python's package manager pip is required for the installation.

## Installation

Unzip acanag.zip on your computer. You then need to open a terminal window (if you are using the Anaconda Navigator App GUI, first
open a terminal window inside your active environment as described above). 

If necessary, type 'ls' into the terminal window to see what folder you are inside currently. You then need to tell the terminal
window to move from where you currently are to inside the main outer folder of the unzipped library on your computer.
Now that you are inside the main outer folder of the library, you can simply type into the terminal window:

    pip install .

Yes, the '.' is part of the command. 

## Usage

See the Jupyter notebook example in doc/source/content/examples. A Jupyter notebook reproducing the results from the associated paper
can itself be found in doc/source/content/Reproducible.
